# Network & Security Learning Journey

This repository documents my structured journey from Network Support into Network Security and Cybersecurity.

It prioritizes hands-on labs, operational scenarios, and real-world failure analysis across networking, security fundamentals, and troubleshooting. Every section documents what I have implemented, validated, broken, recovered, and internalized in practice—not abstract theory or exam-only knowledge.



## About Me

My name is Israel Bamidele. I am an IT professional with hands-on experience in network support and system troubleshooting, currently transitioning into a Network Security role.

My background includes day-to-day support of networked systems, resolving connectivity issues, and working with switching and routing concepts in real environments. Through this repository, I document how I am strengthening my security mindset on top of that foundation.

## Why This Repository Exists

Most learning fails because it stops at videos and certifications.

This repository exists to:
- Document what I learn in simple terms
- Show practical application, not memorization
- Build a repeatable habit of technical documentation
- Create a public record of my growth in networking and security

Think of this as my working notebook, which may serve as ga uide for others to follow.

## Current Focus Areas

My learning currently covers:
- Networking fundamentals (switching, routing, traffic flow)
- Network security concepts and controls
- Basic traffic analysis and visibility
- Troubleshooting from a security perspective
- Preparing for advanced security responsibilities

## Long-Term Goal

My goal is to transition into a Network Security role where I can:
- Protect infrastructure, not just maintain it
- Work alongside experienced security professionals
- Continue building depth in network and cybersecurity engineering
