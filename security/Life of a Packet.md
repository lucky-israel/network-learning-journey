A network engineer sees packets as units of data to be forwarded. A security engineer sees packets as potential lies that need to be checked:

* Is the source IP truthful, or is it spoofed?

* Is this TCP connection legitimate, or part of a DoS attack?

* Is this ARP reply from the real owner of the IP?

* Should this port/VLAN even be sending this type of traffic?
